hello there
this is a test of distraction-free writing
it seems pretty straightforward
and apparently when I get
to line eleven,
then the first line is going to disappear
forever
how would I get it back
then I wonder?
well, that is going
to be a challenge, for sure.
one thing to note is that this
font and the screen layout is very
nice on the eyes
I like the idea of
no editing, just getting your ideas down with no
way whatsoever of going back and reviewing or editing stuff
this could be really useful for working on philosophy papers when doing the phd.
i could follow the "bones" and "writing your dissertation" book ideas and just slam down thoughts as they come and not spend loads of time editing and finessing arguments. Instead, the nub of ideas can come from the mess of unstructured thoughts.
Done.
