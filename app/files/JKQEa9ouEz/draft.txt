So, you are thinking like a consumer. A consumer wants to buy stuff from a store. But is a consumer really your target? Wouldn't it be better to target a business? Businesses have more money, for one thing, right? Wouldn't it be better to target a business that has a lot of money? And wants to spend it?
Too much thinking.
Is the fnCards a good idea? It sure is.
Can I get paid to do it?
Not right away, of course not. But I can get Angel investment after it shows promise, after I show number of users and engagement levels, so forth. If I capture that intermediate market, then that's huge.
It would also make me a better programmer I think.
 I hope.
fnCards could be good, yes. Could I get users? Yes, I suppose I could. How could they login? Should they login?
Probably with github, right? How do you login withgithub? With passport and redis?
Yeah, what kind of database am I going to use? Am I going to stick with redis for the whole shebang? That doesn't seem right, does it? So what do I use? I don't know how to make a schema. There's not a lot of information in this database. So why not stick with redis? It is fast, afterall, right?
I'd rather use my CL, right?
I'd actualyl rather use Clojure, if I knew how Clojure worked.
But I don't. At all.
Why not solve that?
Make a Clojure app?
Use Docker.
Blah blah blah. Really?
I relaly like this first draft app. It really does keep you in the moment. I can't go back, right?
I would use this for writing. I guess I could make it a nodewebkit app, right? Then do what? Release it on firstdraft.io?
IT's kind of already been done, you know/ I got my few seconds of limelight. PEople didn't like it so much, right?
Dude, it didn't work. It didn't export. it didn't do the things that people wanted, right?
Meh.
