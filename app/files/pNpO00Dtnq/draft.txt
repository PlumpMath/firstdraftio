This is a test
I'm writing because i should do this more often
A person is only the sum of their actions
but thoughts seem so real that we get the gratification of doing things that we dont actually do. it's quite annoying.
Start doing.
If you dont, you wont do anything
action is the only course
what else is there?
why is it this way you ast
bcause, well, that's how it goes
start doing things and you'll feel better about yourself
sure, it's hard, but do it, and you'll feel better
do it every day
no excuses
you'll be uncomfortable
but you need to make sacrifices and feel shitty in order to do anything that you REALLY want to do

there is no other way
thoughts are just sparks in your brain. it's great to think, but if you dont act.. well it's pretty useless
you may feel like you're accomplishing something, but if you look at yourself objectively, you'll see that you arent. you have to make sacrifices, to a certain extent.
