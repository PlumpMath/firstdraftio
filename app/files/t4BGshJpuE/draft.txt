So, for anyone getting a huge hard on for these solar roadways. I did some number crunching just to be a jerk. 
Each solar panel is a 3' x 3' hexagon, which is a geometrically inferior geometric shape for surface area to begin with. According to the Federal Highway Administration a normal highway lane is exactly 12' across. Meaning a highway with 4 lanes (two lanes on either side) would be able to fit 16 of these solar units per 3 foot. Recently, the company that makes the product was given $750,000 to convert a 2000 square foot parking lot into a solar parking lot, meaning they produced these units at $375 per unit. So, to convert a single mile of roadway (4 lanes) at 16 units per 3 feet it would take 84,480 panels and $1.552 billion dollars to convert a single mile of roadway.
