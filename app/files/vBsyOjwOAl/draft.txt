# Life Without the Internet; or, The Ingominity of Writing Code nobody cares about.

Yesterday I wrote code. I pushed to github. I read articles. Maybe I wrote a bit. I did "Web Stuff".

The day before ... I did "Web stuff."

The fact is, there's little I do that leaves *any* lasting mark in the physical world; and when I lie down at night, I wonder, ironically, what it would be like if the internet hadn't existed that day. Somone could have watched me get up, brush my teeth, get geared up to Work. And then I sit at my desk, consuming burnt beans from another continent and madly prodding a pad of buttons with a great sense of purpose and determination. My actions are meaningless in the physical world; to a man from a past age, I would look insane. Yet, we call this progress. And it is, in a way.

This keyboard is a door into another world, a world where anything is possible -- a world of dreams. But this world of dreams is impotent; without power, it ceases to exist. It leaves no mark on the world.

Prodding this keyboard is a lot of work. It requires sensation, reflexes, thought, planning. It is terribly complex. But is is only a medium. It has no meaning. It's meaning is dependent on how we use it. 

Sometimes I can't help wonder: if no one sees my code, does it have meaning? Is prodding a keyboard a good way to live? Sometimes, I feel like going outside and digging a ditch. Doing, not thinking. Making an impression on the world, not this world of dreams we have, through our genius and inventive, created.

So it is important to ignore the medium whenever possible, and focus on the message. And if you don't have a message, go did a ditch. Because the Medium is just a dream; it has no meaning by itself.
