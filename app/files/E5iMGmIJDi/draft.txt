So what then? A full-time job?
Forget it.
Better to still have work through 501creative. So better to move to contract work with time to do projects at 501creative at a nice hourly rate.
It is still time for you to move on and get the right income. But a full-time position elsewhere doesn't work.
I get paid higher anyway. I might as well put out the search for a three-month or so freelance gig...
Well, actually, a telecommute job wouldn't be so bad: that Angular one in particular.
The federal reserve? That might work out too.
Yes, it is a pain to go to interviews and so forth. But it is a bigger pain to only get 60k a year.
Maybe Karen will have gotten you a raise. Maybe not. Will see tomorrow night, I suppose.
###
Until then?
Maybe start writing again?
Keep hitting the apps? Keep outputting applications?
I can do so for the Rift now. I can make a rift game. Yes, but it will crash, right?
Yeah, probably. How about the V8 integration into Unreal Engine?
Or just freaking learn unreal engine and c++?
Yeah, how?
###
Or continue building what you built before?
People are using it. Even with all the non-feedback and bad feedback, people are still using it.
Or, at least one person is using it. Looks like one person here and there, using it multiple times. 
So I could improve that experience.
Get crash reports. Get javascript logs. 
Then what? Make IMAX screens? 
No dude, something more cool that that.
Scrape video from places, right?
Get live stream into it? 
meh... not sure how well that would work.
Aren't you just looking for love anyway?
Yeah, I guess so.
So why not go back on those sites to look?
ehhh.... becauseits cheesy.
So, why not find real people to harass?
lol.
ok.
Hope and Mercy.

So. Get your life together, over the next six months?
Then what?
Writing? Web applications? Rift? Full time gigs? Contract gigs?
I honestly don't know.
I guess I put writing first, huh?
Buying and Selling, remember? Just get in the middle of buying and selling.
STripe makes it easy to do that.
why not create another dating site?
Yes, everyone uses mobile now. But why not making a dating site that really works?
Nah.
So.
What then?
Text adventures?
storyfunder.com...
Its a great app idea, I think. It is getting in between people buying and selling, right? Sure is.
It is a simple idea. A kickstarter for stories. But what is special about that? Ah. This is for stories that haven't been written yet. And they only get paid after the story is written and delivered.
Pretty basic.
So there's StoryFunder.
Then there's Rift. Then there's P.
There's a lot of low definition p already. So in that respect, p on the rift is fine. But the really good stuff is higher resolution. So I'm just not sure about it.
Plus, you can't have these things crashing all thetime, right?
Guess not. And I'm not likely to fix NWK anytime soon.
So then? Is Rift out of the question?
I think it is. It is.
So, no rifting?
No, really? Does it really have to be that way? Can't you find a way? Maybe it is only crashing because you are using the voice recognition, you know? Maybe it is only crashing for some reason that you can fix, some reason not connceted to NWK! 
Okay, maybe. So what do you do?
You get rich and then you find the p you're looking for, idiot.
Until then, just hit the p as you desire.
So, gettting rich.
That means getting in between people and theri money, in between buyers and sellers.
That means middle-men.
That means you can pick really just about anything out there that isn't being sold very well, and you can sell it better.
That means nothing too tricky. It also means that if you get into bitcoin, you can do it easily.
Didn't you already think about this/
What can you buy with bitcoin?
You can buy and sell digital stuff easily.
What kind of digital stuff?
Books?
Kindle books?
how about the Amazon store?
People buy from t
blah blah....
Rift P.
There's a huge market. How many people requested an alpha test? Plenty. Maybe 20. That's not exactly a whole heck of a lot, but pm'ing me requires a bit of initiative, you know?
