You might ask yourself the question, what can Social Media do for me and my company? Well that, is a though question to answer and depends on different things how you use it and what you are trying to achieve. For this you can set some S.M.A.R.T. goals to meassure your succes or just go ahead and trial and error to figure out what works for you and what works for your company. As I can discourage the last advice as that might hurt your reputation too much before you even start. Social Media has lots of benifits and oppertunities that are presenting themself every day. Constant stream of updates regarding your contacts, news from the field of expertise you operate in, ease of connecting with new potential customers. After a few months, after you understand the do's and dont's' of this medium and you build up your regular contacts and finetuned your daily stream of news that helps you during the day, you can start collecting some of the fruits you have been taking care of all that time.
