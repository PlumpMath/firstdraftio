## Automathic is a croudsourced repository of mathematical Rules, Formulas, and Equations that's free for anyone to use and contribute to. It gives you the information you need -- concisely presented and neatly organized so you can always find what you need.

### The Problem
Students, teachers, mathemeticans, and pizza cutter waste too much time trying to remeber the formulas for problems they encounter. When you learn math, you learn all kinds of crazy amazing formulas to help you solve problems you might encounter -- but they don't stick in the gray matter.

Wikipedia has great in-depth *theoretical* resources, but it's hard for someone without a PhD to wade through all the information, find what they need, and apply it to thier problem.

### Enter Automathic

Automathic has all the most useful and oft forgetten formulas, and let's you find them easily.

It works like this:
- Users like you submit the formulas they use; a title, the formula, and a short description of how to use it (with links to more in-depth resources if needed)
- Other users determine how they are displayed by voting them up if they use them, and commenting on them if they have a comment or correction.
- You search for what you're looking for ("Triangle" would return formulas to help you find the hypotenuse or area of a triange), or filter by popularity, tag, or date posted.
- Having found what you're looking for (Say, [Area of a Kite](http://automathic.org/159_area-of-a-kite)) you can use it, print it out for a class or easy reference, add a comment, or login to add it to your favorites (where you can find it later, or print out all the formulas *you* use).
- If it helped, vote it up so that it is easier for others to find; also, each formulas has a convenient share link so you can send them to your friends.
