There is a time management framework by Stephen Covey, author of "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People".
My top three are:
1) Be proactive
2) Begin with the end in mind
3) Put first things first

In terms of time management, he defines activities like this:
1) Important, Urgent [think work deadlines]
2) Important, Non-Urgent [think personal and professional growth]
3) Unimportant, Urgent [interruptions]
4) Unimportant, Non-Urgent [time waste]
